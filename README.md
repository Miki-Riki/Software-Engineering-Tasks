**<h2>Polygon Display on Map</h2>**

**<h3>Overview</h3>**

This project demonstrates how to display a polygon on a map using JavaScript and the OpenLayers library. The polygon coordinates are provided in a JSON file, and the code fetches and parses these coordinates to create a polygon feature displayed on an interactive map.

**<h3>Approach</h3>**

1. **Fetching Data:** The code fetches the JSON file containing polygon coordinates using the Fetch API.

2. **Parsing Data:** After fetching the JSON data, it is parsed to extract the polygon coordinates.

3. **Creating Polygon Feature:** The extracted coordinates are used to create a polygon feature using the OpenLayers library.

4. **Setting up the Map:** The polygon feature is added to a vector layer, which is then added to the map along with an OpenStreetMap base layer. Map controls, such as a zoom slider, are also added.

5. **View Configuration:** The map view is configured to fit the extent of the polygon feature.

**<h3>Assumptions</h3>**

The JSON file **`polygon.json`** contains valid polygon coordinates in GeoJSON format.
The JSON data structure is well-defined with a **`polygon`** property containing an array of coordinates.
The map is initialized with default settings such as center coordinates **`[0, 0]`** and zoom level **`2`**.

**<h2>Steps to Run the Code</h2>**

<button id="clone-button" onclick="copyGitCloneCommand()">Copy Git Clone Command</button>
<script>
  <script>
function copyGitCloneCommand() {
    const gitCloneCommand = 'git clone https://github.com/yourusername/polygon-display.git';
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(gitCloneCommand).then(() => {
        alert('Git clone command copied to clipboard!');
    }).catch(err => {
        console.error('Failed to copy Git clone command: ', err);
    });
}
</script>
